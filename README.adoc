# Spring Cloud Gateway interactions with Spring Cloud Data Flow on Kubernetes

In this demo, we show how to integrate Spring Cloud Data Flow with Spring Cloud Gateway.

Spring Cloud Data Flow is a streaming and batch pipeline orchestration system.
Spring Cloud Gatway is a reverse proxy mechanism offered by spring-cloud.

Spring Cloud Data Flow exposes many of the operations it provides through a REST interface.

In this demo, we provide a facade application in which we isolate all the REST calls into Spring Cloud Data Flow.
Then using Spring Cloud Gateway proxy mechanism, the clients interact with SCDF.

There are several benefits for an enterprise to centralize access to the data flow system using a proxy.
Here are some.

### Security
Enterprises can deploy the Spring Cloud Data Flow clusters behind a firewall and then provide access to them only using the gateway.
This way, the security concerns can be centralized only at the gateway level.

### Rate limiting

Spring Cloud Gateway provides built in rate limiting API's using which the number of times SCDF API's access can be controlled.

### Fallback mechanism

If SCDF is down, SCGateway can introduce fallback mechanisms.

## What are the applications provided?

We provide two components.

1. scdf-rest-facade: As the name indicates this is a facade for SCDF REST operations.
This provides a REST endpoint `scdf-facade/publish` that takes `data` as a request parameter.
For example: `/scdf-facade/publish?data=foo`.
Behind the scenes, we invoke the corresponding SCDF operations so that it deploys a stream as `"http | transform --spel.function.expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log"`.
Once the deployment is done, the data `foo` is published. However, this publishing happens asynchronously and the user
gets a repsonse immediately while the deployment is taken place. The response contains a transacion id (UUID)
using which, users can query the status of the deployment. In order to find the status, use the API endpoint
`/scdf-facade/status?transactionId=<id>`.

2. scdf-gateway: This is the gateway application that uses Spring Cloud Gateway to restrict access to
Spring Cloud Data Flow using the facade above. The REST endpoints exposed through the facade are routed through
the gateway.

In the following descriptions, we provide detailed instructions on how to run this demo.

The crux of this demo is centered around the facade code in `scdf-rest-facade` project.

## Running the demo

In this demo, we deploy Spring Cloud Data Flow on Kubernetes using minikube.

Thats where we start.

If you don't have minikube running, go ahead and start it.

For example, `minikube start --driver=virtualbox --cpus=4 --memory=8192`

Once minikube is up and running, bring up the SCDF components.

You can use this tutorial for starting SCDF on minikube: https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/kubectl/

However, you can also throw the following into a shell script and invoke it:

(Make sure, you have Spring Cloud Data Flow checked out locally, if you are trying this)

```
#!/bin/bash

function deploy_scdf_k8s_kafka {
  pushd $SCDF_DIR
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/kafka/
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/mysql/
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-roles.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-rolebinding.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/service-account.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-config.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-config-kafka.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-deployment.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/skipper/skipper-svc.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-svc.yaml
  kubectl create -f src/kubernetes/server/server-deployment.yaml
  popd
}

SCDF_DIR=<PATH-TO-WHERE-YOU-CHECKED-OUT-SCDF>/spring-cloud-dataflow

deploy_scdf_k8s_kafka
```

That will bring up all the components necessary for running this demo.

Once everything is done, `kubectl get all` output should look like the following:

```
Every 2.0s: kubectl get all                                                                                   chackos-a01.vmware.com: Thu Jan 28 20:58:09 2021

Go to this dashboard on a browser: http://192.168.99.97/dashboard/#/apps
(Please change the IP of the scdf-server service accordingly).

Go to applications on the UI and add `Stream application starters for Kafka/Docker`.
This should import all the latest (3.0.0) streaming applications into SCDF.

Go back to a terminal and make sure that you are at the root of this repository.

```
cd scdf-rest-facade
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests jib:dockerBuild
```

That should build the docker image for the facade application and make it availabe in the docker registry used by minikube internally.

```
kubectl create -f src/main/resources/facade.yml
kubectl create -f src/main/resources/facade-svc.yml
```

On another terminal, go to the root of this repo.

```
cd scdf-gateway
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests jib:dockerBuild
```

That should build the docker image for the facade application and make it availabe in the docker registry used by minikube internally.

```
kubectl create -f src/main/resources/gateway.yml
kubectl create -f src/main/resources/gateway-svc.yml
```

This should bring up all the necessary components for both the SCDF facade where we make all the REST calls and the SC Gateway application.

If you do a `kubectl get all` command, it should look like the following

```

```

We want to make sure that all the communication to our SCDF cluster only happens through the gateway application.

We can hit the gateway service by using the minikube IP and the port assigned by NodePort.

My minikube ip is this:

```
 minikube ip
192.168.99.109
```

and the NodePort port for the service `service/scdf-gateway` is `30850`.

Therefore, we can reach the gateway endpoints using 192.168.99.109:30850

Let's publish some data:
```
curl -X POST http://192.168.99.109:30850/scdf-facade/publish --data "data=foo"
```

You should get the following response (or something similar):

```
The infrastructure necessary for publishing your data is being prepared at the moment. Once it is done,your data will be published. In the meantime, you can check this transaction id to check the status on the deployment: bedb6d9c-7d96-4742-840f-db63d05c765d Use the REST endpoint /status?transactionId=<transaction-id> for finding the status.
```

You can check the status of the deployment as below using gateway:

```
curl -w '\n' -X GET "http://192.168.99.109:30850/scdf-facade/status?transactionId=bedb6d9c-7d96-4742-840f-db63d05c765d"
Deployment status: false
```

Let's try to publish more data:

```
curl -X POST http://192.168.99.109:30850/scdf-facade/publish --data "data=bar"

Check the status on the publishing using the tranaction ID: 36d54019-fb4b-490b-80f7-025229724312 Use the REST endpoint /status?transactionId=<transaction-id> for finding the status.%
```

Once the stream is deployed, you should see these pods in your `kubectl get all` output:

```
Every 2.0s: kubectl get all                                                                                   chackos-a01.vmware.com: Thu Jan 28 21:16:19 2021

```

Let's tail the log pod:

```
kubectl logs -f pod/publish-to-kafka-log-log-v1-8645f8f8cd-zjck2
```

You should see this in the output:

```

```

## Conclusion

In this demo, we verified that, we can interact to Spring Cloud Data Flow using its REST operations by providing a gateway component in front.

In order to tear down on all the components, do the following.

Go the SCDF UI, and destroy the stream that was created.
```
kubectl delete rs,deployment,pod,service -l type=scdf-gateway
kubectl delete rs,deployment,pod,service -l type=scdf-facade
```

```
kubectl delete all,pvc,secrets -l app=mysql
kubectl delete all,cm -l app=skipper
kubectl delete all -l app=kafka
kubectl delete all,cm -l app=scdf-server
kubectl delete role scdf-role
kubectl delete rolebinding scdf-rb
kubectl delete serviceaccount scdf-sa
```
